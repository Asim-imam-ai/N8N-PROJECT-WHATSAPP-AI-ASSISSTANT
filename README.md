WhatsApp AI Assistant Built with n8n!

I’ve developed a complete AI-powered WhatsApp Assistant using n8n — featuring a multi-agent system and an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent.
 This project showcases how automation and AI can transform WhatsApp into a smart, business-ready assistant.
🧠 Key Features:
Google Gemini Model – Powers intelligent responses and contextual understanding.
Memory System – Enables personalized interactions with users.
Calculator Agent – Instantly calculates business rates, pricing, and profit margins.
SERP API Integration – Delivers real-time news updates for any country or city.
Email Automation – Reads unread emails, sends messages to clients, and manages replies directly through WhatsApp.
Contact Management Tool – Creates, updates, or deletes customer contacts from WhatsApp.
Writer Tool – Generates creative content like stories, essays, poems, and applications on demand.
Calendar Integration – Creates, updates, and deletes events directly via WhatsApp.
Pinecone Vector Database – Stores and retrieves business details, product information, and pricing using RAG.
💬 With this system, businesses can interact with customers naturally on WhatsApp — getting instant answers, managing data, and automating daily operations with AI.
This project is a great example of how no-code automation (n8n) + AI models (Gemini) + vector databases (Pinecone) can create powerful, real-world business solutions.
